HCI
Group Project (sem. 2)


This document describes the Project to be completed by the students who are taking the HCI course in 2025-26.

Learning outcomes
The coursework is designed to give students first-hand experience of an interaction design project. The students will undergo the entire design cycle (ideation, design, and evaluation) to reach a medium-fidelity prototype, applying techniques and methodologies introduced in the course. Prototyping of different fidelity will be used to support the communication of design ideas between the designers’ team and to support user testing. The project includes both individual and group activities. Students are exposed to typical group-work dynamics and learn how to share information and coordinate activities during an interaction design project. Furthermore, the project addressing the European Green Deal will be valuable for the students’ professional development, as sustainable development is predicted to become increasingly important on all types of industries and sectors.

This group project will be conducted over semester 1 – Deadline January 23rd of January 2026. 

Background and rationale
The 12th of the UN sustainable development goals requires new strategies for promoting responsible consumption and production (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/). The focus of the project will be limited to designing interactive systems to persuade consumers to be thoughtful about what they buy and to choose a sustainable option whenever possible. The application field is sustainable fashion. 

The case study is Kauristore – a network of shops in South Tyrol devoted to sustainable fashion. The client wants to increase their customer base. One of the biggest obstacles to this goal is the higher price of sustainable fashion and a generalised unawareness of the long-term reward of sustainable shopping. Another problem is the difficulty of finding salespeople and instructing them about the specifics of the many different brands sold in the shops.

To address this problem, Kauristore is planning to deploy a robot in one of its shops. It will need to support the salesperson describing the products, explaining their characteristics, and advertising the good. Furthermore, it may provide games and entertaining functions for children, while the parents shop. 



Starting from these general requirements, the students are asked to design the mid-fidelity prototype (looks like, feels like and interact like the final system, although does not contain all the computational features of it). The system will eventually be displayed on the screen of a robot. In doing so, students will learn how to collect requirements, prioritise them and set up achievable design goals, which will be finally evaluated with a sample of users.  

The goal of this project is to design a mid-fidelity prototype of how an interactive digital artefact may address one or more of these goals. The focus is on the user-interfaces. Do not refrain your self to apps and websites, think of the variability of interfaces we have discussed so far. 

Procedure
The project will be organised around the following activities: Ideation, Requirements elicitation; Design and Evaluation. Specific steps are described below
Ideation: the group will engage in a number of ideas generation and brainstorming exercises to identify the space of the design they want to address. This phase will give rise to initial design directions which will be iteratively tested and modified during the project 
PACT ANALYSIS. Following a PACT analysis each group will identify and describe stakeholders, context of use, and the set of activities they wish to support with their project, broadly defining the interaction technology required. 
Design phase. Each group will implement different low fidelity prototypes such as scenarios, personas, and story board etc. The group will consolidate and evaluate the proposals in a smaller set of alternatives.
Evaluation phase. Students will evaluate selected interfaces in user testing 
Design phase. Each group will incrementally improve the prototypes up tp a mid-fidelity solution which will be tested with a sample of at least 10 users. 
Report writing. The group will produce a 10 pages (max) report of the project and a working prototype of the system. Report writing is both an individual and a group activity. All members are expected to contribute and the report will be marked as a group deliverable not as a collection of chapters authored by different people. The report will be composed of:
Executive summary (1/2 page stating the main design goal, reporting the findings and recommendation for future work)
Design methodology (methods, procedures and tools used in the design)
Ideation phase methods and low fidelity prototyping
PACT analysis (rich description of the design space with implications for requirements) 
Key quality metrics: define the KPI of the system in terms of usability, UX, social innovation (with reference to envinronmental goals)
Interface description (presentation and justification of main design choices showing their evolution in time)
Evaluation Results (user study): comment on usability, user experience, 
Conclusion (recommendations, suggestion for further design research)
The report will be due on January Friday 23rd of January. It will be marked independently of the prototype to be demonstrated the day of the exam. The report will carry 50% of the mark, the oral examination with the demo will also carry 50%. Both sessions must be sufficient for passing the exam. The students should demonstrates theoretical and practical knowledge of interaction design.  
Help and contact information
The work will be carried out independently by the students, following the activities proposed in the class. Collective feedback sessions will be held in the class, to discuss and review the work. It is of utmost importance to the success of the project that each member of the group contributes to the work. In case of problems and conflicts which students are unable to deal with independently, they are invited to contact Prof. De Angeli, by e-mail (cc all group members). People who do NOT contribute to the group work will receive a lower mark (up to 0 in case of no contribution at all. Student feedback will be gathered at the end of the work. 

Deliverable will be marked based on the assessment of 
Presentation (10%);
Validity and reliability of methodologies of user centred design (30%);
Analysis of results (20%);
Understanding of key HCI concepts (10%) 
Quality of design suggestions (20%);
Reflections and suggestions for further design (10%).

Prototypes will be marked during the oral examination with reference to:
Presentation (pitch) (10%); 
Presentation (mastery of concepts, tools and techniques) 30% 
Originality of the idea (10%);
Pragmatic quality of the interface (30%);
Hedonic quality of the interface  (20%);

Examples of target and quality indicators promoted by the 12th sustainable development goal.
